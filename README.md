# **Pareto-Optimal-Staircase-Analysis**

## **Project Goal**

This project implements the **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithm to compute the **Pareto-Optimal Points** (the "Staircase") in a set of 2D points. The goal is to verify the algorithm's efficient theoretical time complexity of  through numerical experiments.
